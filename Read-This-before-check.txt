***********************FIRST*****************************

-The project has database which consists of three endPoints [employeesData,currentLogedEmp,employeeDataBending]
	1)emloyeesDate-end point: is the actual employees exists on the system after admin confirmation 
	2)currentLogedEmp-end point : is the current logged in employee who may be (employee or security)
	3)employeeDataBending-end point : is the pending applicant who apply on registraion form waiting for admin confirmation 

***********************SECOND*****************************
-The project has designed for only one admin who has:
	username: admin_999
	password: iti@123

***********************THIRD*****************************
-PLease take care that the project is automaticly apply attendence data at 4:00 PM if:
	- employee forgot to punchout
	- employee didn't came today 

**in that order if you try to apply attendece after 4:00 PM for any employee exits in system that won't work 
to turn-off these two features -> from file "./js/security.js" you will find two called functions:
	1)checkAbsence();
	2)checkPunchOut();
turn it off and it will work
